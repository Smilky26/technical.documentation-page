             Yoru grew up in Tokyo, possibly in the split, as hinted by one of<br>
             his dialogues. He is currently looking for a lost ancestor who might<br>
             be connected to the samurai in Icebox.<br>
             Yoru’s abilities were influenced by Ferrofluid, which is<br>
             a liquid affected by magnetic poles. They are generally<br>
             made of nanoscale ferromagnetic or ferrimagnetic particles suspended<br>
             in a carrier fluid, generally an organic solvent or water.<br>

          <div class="tips_text">
              <h3>Tip 1: Fake it till you make it</h3>
              <p>After having played Yoru during Riot’s Episode 2 Act 1 early access build, we should note<br>
                that Fakeout is perfect for fake site rushes. All Yoru players need to do is drop two<br>
                Fakeout abilities and aim them towards a site at the start of the round. If enemy players<br>
                don’t peek to see the rush, they will most likely tell their teammates to begin to rotate.<br><br>
                A more creative way to use Fakeout is during post-plant situations. After taking over a<br>
                site and planting the spike, defenders will often wait for their teammates before<br>
                attempting a retake. Yoru can then use his Fakeout ability to trick enemy agents into<br>
                thinking someone is pushing from the site. This may delay the retake attempt, or even<br>
                convince the enemy team that someone has gone behind their lines.<br><br>
                For defenders, Fakeout can be used to fake an early rotation, which could bait the enemy<br>
                team into thinking a position on the map is clear.<br>
              </p>
          </div>
        <div class="tips_text">
          <h3>Tip 2: Win your duels with a pop flash</h3>
          <p>Yoru’s Blindside will pop after a single bounce, which results in what is known as a pop<br>
             flash. This also happens when a player throws a perfectly timed flash that doesn’t give<br>
             opponents time to react. Players can get creative with certain angles on the map, and<br>
             use Blindside to come out of smoke, similar to Phoenix’s Curveball or Reyna’s Leer.<br>
          </p>
          </div>
          <div class="tips_text">
            <h3>Tip 3: Keep your opponents guessing</h3>
            <p>While on attack, players shouldn’t be afraid to throw the Gatecrash ability towards a site<br>
               or behind enemy lines. Again, enemy agents need to be within nearsighted range to see<br>
               and shoot the moving orb. Once their teammates make their move towards the site, a<br>
               player can then teleport behind enemy lines.<br><br>
               Players can also use the Gatecrash ability to get themselves out of sticky situations.<br>
               While on the attackers’ side, Yoru may leave a Gatecrash orb where the rest of his team is<br>
               making their move, while he fakes a push or a lurk play around the map. He can then<br>
               teleport to his team before the orb expires.<br><br>
               Meanwhile, on the defenders’ side, Yoru can hold one-and-done angles with an Operator.<br>
               If the enemy team chooses to use their abilities to get him off his defensive position, Yoru<br>
               can easily teleport out and reposition himself, which will likely catch opponents<br>
               by surprise.<br>
           </div>

           <div class="tips_text">
             <h3>Tip 4: Become the ultimate scout for your team</h3>
             <p> As Dimensional Drift may be used for a long duration, players will definitely utilize it to<br>
                get behind enemy lines. But the best way to maximize this ability is to make sure that<br>
                you call out everything you see. And because Yoru is invulnerable while in his ultimate,<br>
                players shouldn’t be afraid to get close to opponents, or see which corner or angle<br>
                they’re holding.<br>
          </div>
          <div class="tips_text">
            <h3>Tip 5: Become the ultimate duelist and take multiple fights</h3>
            <p>The best way to outplay opponents using Yoru is to pair his Dimensional Drift ultimate<br>
              with the Gatecrash teleport. Players can use Yoru’s ultimate to gain information on the<br>
              enemy team and exit the Drift at a safe location. This will force the enemy team to<br>
              coordinate and watch their flanks, while keeping an eye out for Yoru’s teammates.</p><br><br>
